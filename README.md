# Apache OpenOffice Documentation Project

## Repository for Apache OpenOffice Documentation

### Purpose

This repository will be used for Revision Control for all master Documentation files for Apache OpenOffice (AOO). Documentation will be written primarily using Writer, the word processing component of AOO, as well as other components as needed.

### Structure

1. Each version of the documentation will have its own branch named for the Guide that it holds as well as one for Miscellaneous Documents and Templates.
    
   - Each branch will have two folders named  Review and Published
     - Review will be used for the editing process before a document is accepted
	 - Published will be used to contain the Published versions for that branch
     - If Guides are translated a language folder will be added for each language translated.
